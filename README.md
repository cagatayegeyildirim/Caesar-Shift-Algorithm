# Caesar-Shift-Algorithm

I created a function named "caesar_encrypt". Then I created two arrays named "ciphertext_out" and "crypted_text". Later, I created an "alphabet" sequence to examine and shift the letters in my text file. I changed all the letters in my font file to uppercase with the upper() command because my "alphabet" array only includes uppercase letters. My for loop is getting the words from the text file. It converts the words they receive into letters and checks if "alphabet" is in the array. Then I numbered the letters step by step with the index command. Then I used Caesar's Algorithm ((x+n)Mod26). After the process was completed, I added my encrypted message into my crypted_text array that I created at the beginning, and to print it on the screen, I added it to my "ciphertext_out" array and returned the function.
